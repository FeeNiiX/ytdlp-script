# ytdlp-script

You need [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp)

and [ffmpeg](https://github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds/releases/tag/latest)

You can make a directory to put Download.bat, yt.dlp.exe and ffmpeg.exe

Or you can set it as a system variable

### How

its in portuguese but you should figure it out where all of this is

since you are smart enough to know what yt-dlp is.
